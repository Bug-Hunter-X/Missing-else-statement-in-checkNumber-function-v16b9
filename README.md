This bug demonstrates a common error in JavaScript functions: a missing `else` statement to handle all possible cases.  The `checkNumber` function correctly identifies positive and negative numbers, but fails to account for the case where the input number is 0. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the application. The solution provides a corrected function that includes an `else` statement to explicitly handle the case of 0.
